     Tutorial to help user start our web page.

     ![](.\click_add_new_memory.png)

     User can start our web page by adding the memoyr which can be used as sources to write personal statement.

     ![](.\upload_memory.png)

     This is adding memory format given by JOBIS to the user.

     ![](.\add_questions.png)

     User can add the personal statement questions given by the company.

     Or can write a simple memo for each memory.

     ![](.\write_comment.png)

     And choose memory and build a story of themselves which is used for the specific question.

     Finally, user can write a draft of the paper by refer to the memos, comment, and story that they made.

      

   - **Quality arguments**

     - **Neat features**

       We tried to maintain simplicity of the prototype while convey useful features to the user to increase users' learnability. To achieve simplicity, we tried some techniques as follow.

       - Color: We tried to use as few color as possible. First, we designed our tool bar and some unique button (start paper button in personal statement page) with sky-blue color (we used pastel tone to reduce eye stress of the user), which is the main color of our prototype. Green color is used for next and confirm button which inform that user can "progress" with the green color button. Red color is used for delete button to inform user warning, and pens indicating memory in the "Life chart" stage to give perception that the memory is more "important". And we also used gray and black color for some boxes and back ground color.
       - Double duty: To achieve simplicity, we used double duty UIs. For example, progress bar which reside at upper side in the edit paper stages works as stage indicator and also works as a page linker if you click it.
       - Hover: We also implemented our prototype with some hover effect to hide information when it is not needed, and give information when user hovers the button. For example, in the add question stage, if you hover '+' button at the bottom of the page, "add question" text pops up with the animation and conveys such information.

     - **Visual design**

       - Icon design with good metaphor. Using proper icon, user can intuitively catch the concept. Calendar like icon for memories and Paper like icon for personal statement. 

     - **Usability**

       - User guide (Learnability, efficiency): Lead user to proper page with buttons. Our service is basically one big process consists of several steps, so it is easy to following. However, there were some moments user may lost the way. Thus, we provide buttons leading user naturally starting with tutorial.
       - Loading page (Learnability, safety): We show overlayed loading page initializing web page. User can know it is loading data by seeing loading overlay and cannot do some risky action. It can provide safety of overall service and also one way to make user comfortable. 
       - Consistency (Learnability): We try to achieve high consistency in both internal and external. For internal consistency we unify the design. For example we use few color and similar color for similar things. Also the shape of button or box is all same and we consider font, size and position of text. For external consistency, we design the UI to make user comfortable and natural comparing with other UIs. For example, menu bar design and position of component are same with other UIs. And also we use shape and component which user can see easily at other services like progress bar, button shape and position of buttons.
       - Safety issues: Warning every irreversible action. For example, we show pop up warning when user try to delete memory or question. It can protect miss click of user and also make user feel free to exploring. Also we tested a lot of situations, checked database problems and fixed them all. Also, we support auto save which happen if user move to another page or do some action.
       - Learnability issues: We notice user when user miss to fill out essential component. Also we provide why user cannot go further so user can easily change it and progress to the next stage with no future problem related to unfilled essential data.
       - Efficiency issues: Fixed header tool bar always located at same position every moment through whole process of service to help user to access it fast. 

     - **Novel UI components you designed**

       We tried to achieve familiar UI rather than novel UI. So, we used intuitive UIs as possible to help user with the learnability issues.

     - **Hardcore implementation**

       Sadly, we did not used any frameworks help build our prototype. We tried really hard to implement every animation and effects especially in the "Life chart" stage.

   - **Read me before using our prototype!!!**

     We only support one user. Please don't use our prototype simultaneously at the same time. Login is automatically done, but if you logged out, please use "ID: testuser1, PW: 1234" or just click log in button.

     

2. ##### **Iteration**

   - Change terminology "Project" to "Personal statement"

     We found out while user testing that many participants don't understand the meaning of "Project" and had hard time starting our task 1. So we decided to change our terminology "Project" into "Personal statement".

   - Tool bar order changed (Project, Memory => Memory, Personal statement)

     We also changed the order and label of the tool bar to fit with the terminology changing. And, considering that adding new memory stage comes before writing the personal statements, 

   - New button added - tutorial stage

     During our after user testing interview with participants, some participants gave us feedback that it will be better if there is some button to guide them. So, we added start tutorial button at the beginning of the homepage and made a button that guide user to start by recall their new memory.

   - Add new memory icon design changed - Uploading experience stage

     We changed new memory icon with dot border to feel it more like adding new one.

   - Delete question button changed - Question upload stage

     Some user confused to delete personal statement questions, so we changed the arrow button next to the question number to make it more clickable.

   - Life chart move left limitation - Life chart stage

     Life chart goes left infinity, so we changed it not to move before the very first memory of the user.

   - See life chart button changed - Write draft stage

     Color changed from gray into green to make it more clickable.

   - Question indicator added - Write draft stage

     Many participant made a mistake that instantly push the confirm button instead of next button when there is question 2 is still empty. So we decided to make a question number indicator right above the confirm button to indicate what question they are writing.

     

3. ##### **Individual reflection**

   - **Jeonghun Moon**

     ??What worked well in our team is that every student does something well. For example, I know nothing about  Photoshop and video editing, but there is someone in our team knows how to do those things. On the other hand, I am relatively good at writing report, designing, hand drawing, implementing prototype. So, we helped each other to teach what we are good at. We had hard time while choosing the design of our UIs. There were many people in the team and had different idea even if we are all thinking of designing in perspective of the user. For example, some of us thought long and narrow rectangular box is needed but others might think long and wide rectangular box is needed for user input. We tried to solve this problem by explaining why each of us thought that this design is better in perspective of user, and decided final design with the voting as we did in the class. From this, I learned there can be many ways to achieve one single goal (as we derived in the POV stage). Sadly, most UI design was discarded and changed after doing user testing in the different level of fidelity, because user acted totally different as we thought. Also, there was many usability issues occurred which was impossible to predict if we didn't conducted user testing. So, I learned user testing must be conducted to achieve user-centered design. In addition, from the fact that many different type of usability issues occurred at the different level of the user testing, I learned that iterative design of prototype and keep developing our prototype with many user testing is necessary while we are doing the user-centered design. 

     ??For the prototype, I contributed progress bar, box design, font design, add button, next button, add question stage page, and life chart stage page as I mentioned in the DP6 report. I tried really hard to make the buttons more clickable to make it learnable for user. Also, I tried to convey much information with the simple UI design. To achieve those features, I focused on designing UIs to give user the feeling that they are interacting with the UIs. So, I take a special care and used hover effect and clicking effect when user explores the web page with their mouse cursor.

     ??One last thing that made our implementation really hard was that we didn't use any frameworks. So, we has to implement all the effects by ourselves, but thanks to that, now I can implement many effects for example, moving animation and color & shape changing. Just now, I know there are frameworks help build the web pages, I really want to use it next time and figure out what it does.

     1. What worked well and not in your team? How did you overcome any hurdle in teamwork? What lesson about teamwork did you learn that you might apply to your next team project?
         Because we worked in team, it is hard to make a solution for topic and design that satisfies every member?셲 opinions. Thus, we had a lot of meeting and spend much time to make a good solution. Also it feels less free than working alone. As we use github I should check whether there is any change that other team member makes and there should agreement for each change.
         We did not use any tool for implementation. It seems other teams used some tools to implement. We did not know there are some good tools to use and just start coding. So, I think we had to do spend more time because we did not use any tool. Thus, I will search whether there are some tools appropriate for my project next time.
     2. Through the team-based design project experience, what did you learn about the user-centered design process and web-based GUI implementation?
         First, for user centered design process, it takes long time. Actually, we once changed our topic at the start of semester, so we should do user interview/ survey again. We should spend more time to do change the topic but it works better I think. As it takes much more time than just design by ourselves, it helped us to find out user needs and make some insights. Our result may be not good enough, however I think it is much better than what I expected at the beginning. 
         The user centered steps we processed also teach us what we missed and what we should improve. There is a big chance to miss some important features when we focus on the other things. For example, we did design interface wrong because we just focused on functionality of the web page. However, user testing made us to know the fault and we could fix it. I could learn the user centered process is important because it make us not to lost our final goal. 
         For web based implementation, I had difficult time because there are many ways to implement even if it is the same design. It was hard to choose how to implement and know what feature the  implementation has and which is better. I feel that HTML, CSS and Javascript are relatively high level because I cannot know how it works actually inside. Also, since it is graphical design, the size and position of components are important. Thus, I should adjust detailed size and position value. One more thing which was difficult is choosing color. The aesthetic factors were very unfamiliar for me. These processes take long time and many trials, so I think experience is so important.
         I think web based programming is relatively easy to work on team. Since web works based on an individual web page, it was easy to divide the work. Both front-end and back-end are separate by page in simple web implementation. Even if there are some features that should be consistent through whole web pages, it is easy to achieve because HTML, CSS and Javascript have different responsibility for each.

     -What worked well and not in your team? How did you overcome any hurdle in teamwork? What lesson about teamwork did you learn that you might apply to your next team project?

     We had no hesitation in suggesting new ideas. We had very spent very little time in collecting ideas, and picking the best one. We frequently suggested features that are very different from existing one, and had a short time talking about that's strengths and weaknesses. if it is determined that the idea is great, we applied it to the existing one. Our ideas and selections are distributed in the details of our web page.
     We didn't have friendly codding style, that is, not only easy for myself, but also easy for everyone. We divided our task into several pieces, and did our own tasks. The problem happened when we have to use other's codes. In the "Draft" part that I did, I have to use "Life chart" and "Build your story". It was easy to get comment(text data) in "Build your story", but using memory list in "Build your story" and flow chart in "Life Chart" was very hard. Especially, "Life Chart" was not able to understand in short time, because I didn't catch his coding style, and he didn't know my coding style. I had to choose, just copy his codes and lose details in Draft, or learn about his implementation method and lose time. I determined to copy it because it was D-1.
     I learned that our bad first step would affect our work time critically. When we implement server by firebase, we talked about the usage of keys. one thought that we do not need to use key, so we can use it as a name, like project name, memory title, e.t.c. the other(me and one) thought that having another variable "name" in the key is more useful. We selected first one, and we have to fix it in the future. it took long time.

     

     -Through the team-based design project experience, what did you learn about the user-centered design process and web-based GUI implementation?

     The most important learn in the project was that users' view is quite different from mine, though I tried to act like user. No matter how much I think about users' view and develop from that, the user test always had unexpected questions. It shocked me, and I felt the importance of user test.
     I learned that building web was quite different from making algorithm or functions. It was always built in graphic window, so I got feedback frequently. And it never gave me the message, "Wrong" or "Correct".(except coding mistake) My task was "choosing", when there are 2 different codes that work same but have different design. learnings from class may gave hints about that, but eventually I had to make the final decision.

     ??In the case of the overall UI design and layout, it seems that the conference was held smoothly and had a meeting to coordinate four opinions. It seemed to be efficient because it showed prominent progress which made each advantage. I was particularly impressed with the image functions of Photoshop and Premiere, and the other special functions that were used variously, such as summary and report, UI progress bar, and overall framework management.

     ??However, there were some burdens. When creating the final work, we needed some work to give the whole homepage uniformity, but there were a lot of different parts of each coding style and there was some difficulty in fitting it. This problem was solved to some extent by the talk between the existing code writer and the writer who should use it. Nonetheless, some of the code was not delivered and understood well, so we often ended up working together. Anyway, it was the code I wrote and it was a good part of the whole work, so it was good for everyone to act responsibly.
     I think it was not easy to coordinate the time for group work because the schedule between the individuals was different. Most of the weekend seems to have invested in work. It seems to me that the day to meet in the day, to do the coding and the meeting together, and to finish late at night was a lot.

     ??As for teamwork, I thought that it would be necessary to take precautions in order to make it easier for users to use the annotation processing and preprocessing work in the coding work. The original writer also had to spend time to explain his code so he could not proceed with the other work, and it took longer than writing the authors to use it alone. I heard.
     Also, before writing the actual code, I felt that it is important to have sufficient pre-meeting for the overall unity. I think that it has had a great impact on the production of human-friendly, solid results while listening to their opinions and accepting good parts.

     ??As for the user-centered design, I often feel that when I was in the user's position, the problem with the GUI, which was often found, was not visible when I was a developer. I learned that there is a need to look at this GUI implementation with a more objective eye. In addition, I thought that it is necessary to observe it carefully because it is inconvenient more than thought if the items which thought that it is trivial are not enough. For example, in the Draft section, people would press the Confirm button instead of the NEXT or PREV button, which might not be enough for the Next button, but more importantly, it was difficult for the user to know that drafting for all items was not completed I think. As a way to solve this problem, I thought that adding a small part to add the current page etc could have a bigger effect than I thought.
